"Changing" artifacts may be deleted when they are older than a specific age (based on their mtime). Here you can specify a number of regular expressions to describe which artifacts shall be treated as "changing".
This could be versions ending with <tt>-SNAPSHOT</tt> or <tt>-I148</tt> ("integration builds"), for example.

Enter one regular expression per line.
